# Pi-hole with DNS over TLS resolvers as Docker containers

I use this docker-compose file to run [Pi-hole 5](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole) on a Raspberry Pi in a macvlan network (ipv6 supported) together with two instances of [DNS over TLS upstream server](https://github.com/qdm12/cloudflare-dns-server).
